## What is cumbox?
Cumbox is a little tool I made that can turn your Raspberry Pi into a dongle to run checkra1n (or whatever you want) at the click of a button.
## What is a cumbox?
It's best you dont know ._.
# How do I use cumbox?
Clone the repo, and run the installer. Or better yet, download the deb file from the releases tab.

## Plans in the future
 - ~~Make cumbox continue when the button is pressed.~~
 - Add checkra1n.
